### 硅谷

Why isn't this book about tech?

I didn't write about tech because tech destroys worlds.

And I, I wanted to create--

May I have a token for the restroom, please?

So, you guys are planning to build your own external antennas to deploy for the Hawaii test?



You see the chick in the racism car?

I banged her in the **famine 荒野** truck.

I'm sorry. What is this?

It's the **trailer 预告片** for my festival.

I **literally 简直** love you. 

We are trying to launch a huge ==pilot== program in Hawaii.

pilot n.飞行员    adj. 试点的

Dinesh is actually ==heading out there== first thing tomorrow morning, and I **am about to (将要做.....)** sit down with the network operations president of AT&T, trying to **close 成交** this **massive 巨大的** deal, but that all depends on getting Hawaii right. There's just no way we could do both.

And you would rather do Hawaii than RussFest?

==How come(Why)== whenever you guys wanna do some shit, I'm always like, "fuck yeah!". But whenever I wanna do some cool shit, you guys **piss all over it 在上面撒尿=泼冷水**! You know what? ==Gimme(give me)== this.

What have I been telling you, Lawrence?

Impressive. Very impressive.

Looking forward to talking a lot more.

Yeah, **definitely(一言为定)**. 

==How did it go 进展如何?==

I wanna **keep it on the down-low 低调点**

**It could not have gone better. 不能更顺利了**

When they found out how much money they could save by using us to help **simplify(简化)** their 5G **rollout 试运行**, they ==practically 几乎== shit themselves. This could be bigger than we thought.

Monica, we could be on 100 million phones.

**Holy shit. 天哪**

You know, focus on Hawaii, make sure we land the plane.

It's weird. I actually don't know what to do when things are going well. It is not natural.

What's the newest ==killer杀手级== app coming out of Silicon Valley? 

Would you believe **ethics 道德**? It's all thanks to our first guest, a ==former 前任的== big-tech CEO turned responsible tech **evangelist 布道者**... 

You know what?(你知道吗？)==Not even 甚至不== this **turd 粪** is gonna bring me down right now.

caution and ==accountability 有责任感==. Thanks for being here.

Well, I ==always find time for you 很乐意做某事==, Gabby. 

My message **invigorates (鼓舞)** me.

For too long, these large tech companies have harvested our data, they have ==violated our privacy 窥探我们的隐私==, they have **tracked 追踪** our every move.

They is you, you **hypocrite 伪君子**. You did that. 

Starting today, I will be asking **prominent 杰出的** members of the tech community to ==sign their name onto this==.

==A code of conduct 行为准则==, authored by me, that **pledges 保证** them to a universal ethos, which I created, that I call, "tech ethics".....

Richard, I have your tea. 我把你的茶端来了。

No one in town is ever gonna sign this.

==Well, I'm sold(on it). 我被说服了==

and let us know where you stand[^翻译]. 

[^翻译]:告诉我们你的想法



Why is the television on the news? 为什么电视在播新闻？

I don't need you telling me my job, okay?

I know things have been a bit **antagonistic 敌对的** between us.

==I've been thinking about it==, and you work for Richard, and I want ==what's best== for him.

cause I want him to be happy, so from now on... 

Even if you make the **occasional oopsie 偶尔出错**.

Why would I do that to my best friend?

Absolutely not！绝对不行

We haven't told you what we want yet.

**Irrelevant. 无关痛痒** 

Because I have no idea what the fuck that is.

It's the system that Tracy created for employees to give feedback on  senior management.

The point is, I happen to know a lot of folks over at AT&T, and I think it might help us if I back-channel some of the information I've gathered.

**But before I do 在这之前**, I'd like to tell you how you're doing.

Your **acumen n.敏锐** scores are excellent.

On a **scale 等级体系** of one to 10, you're ==at a 9.9==. 

So, all 10's and ... Dinesh.

But, it's your **interpersonal 人际关系的** rating I'd like to ==drill down 深度探讨== ==on==. It's at 1.5.

Your coworkers find you unapproachable, rude, and **==capable 有某种能力== of great hurt 能造成巨大伤害** with an **unsettling 令人不安（或紧张、担忧）的** stare.

We want AT&T to see a **thriving[^thrive] 有活力的** company.

[^thrive]:v. 繁荣昌盛 v+ing做形容词

If you really make a **concerted effort 共同努力** at **outreach 拓展** and team building, you could get your numbers up.

I ==appreciate== you ==wanting== to **participate in** the world of numbers.

I find it ==endearing 可爱的==.

But yours are horseshit.

==They measure nothing. 它们毫无意义==

If I wanted to, I could have all 10's **==by== the end of the week 本周末之前**.

Gilfoyle, metrics like Piper-Pulse are a widely accepted measure of how your ==peers 同事== feel about you.

Speaking of, Monica, your interpersonal is at a 2.

No, that's just because *Priyanka and her little witch's nest over at Foxhole* are bringing my numbers down.

No. Most of your lower scores are coming from engineers, who are 84% male.

Whatever I do, I'm sure I could do it better than you.

You wanted him to become a certified scuba before the trip, right?

For the day? No, for all of it.从头到尾

**in first class 在一等舱**

I think ==a lot of what Gavin is saying== makes sense.

I've been saying it for years.

So, you agree with him?

because I ==mean it 认真的==!

That feels ==petty 小气== and personal, which is against Gavin's code of tethics.

That doesn't really make any sense. 这才叫讲不通 

Did you just publicly **insult 侮辱** my boss?

Because loudmouths like you got up in front of **Congress 国会** and **whined 发牢骚** about how somebody needed to do something about big tech.

And we all have to fall in line, or we'll be in **PR hell 公关噩梦**. Or worse! We'll face government **regulation监管**.

**It means nothing. 毫无意义**

I sense a certain **lack of 缺乏** **commitment诚意**.

I'd be happy to be your **moral 道德** **mentor 导师**.

The **groundbreaking动工** for the **institute研究所**.

dedicated to 致力于

Be good to have you there. 很高兴你能去

I was quickly perusing your **file 履历**

That's not `what` peruse means.

==Peruse 研读== means to read ==thoroughly 认真地== and carefully.

That's the worst case of **contact dermatitis 接触性皮炎** I have ever seen.

The itching is so insane!

oughta **take care of it in no time 立即见效**.

Now, **before we proceed 开始前**, I should warn you the shot.

What else has he been stealing?

How are you `getting these people` to like you?

gaining someone's confidence is easy.

So, you guys **raised some issues 对...有意见** with Piper-Pulse, So I really started **looking into 仔细研究** it, and it **turns out 最终发现**, there are some problems with its reliability as a ==metric 度量==. So, I'm shuting it down.

I don't really have time for you right now.

Should I look at the camera or you?

You can just talk to me. Can you introduce yourself?

Could we cut the music for a second?

I have a surprise for everybody.

Hey！ There you are. I got you something.

I had my assistant **frame 装裱** it.

It's your very close friend.

Well, you had plenty of opportunity to invest.
