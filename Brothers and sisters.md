Brothers and sisters

I'm going to be just as brave as you are.  我会向你一样勇敢

It's been a while since I've heard from you.  很久没有你的消息了

Sarah has a lot on her plate. She and Joe are still **separated 分居**.

Jason has been such ==a good influence on him 对他有好的影响==. 

I'm in a park with the most competitive moms in America.

Reverend Boyfriend's **giving me the evil eye 瞪着我**. ==Got to go 先挂了==.

Tommy's ==got his hands full 忙得不可开交== with the winery and the baby.

I **offered to 提出** help, but Tommy says Julia's doing fine.

==be thrilled to 感到兴奋激动== 

I think that right now our first priority is the campaign.

Oddly 奇怪地

I said I wouldn't ==panic 惊慌== until it was 21 days.

Well, it's been 21 days and I haven't heard a single thing from him.

Come on, Nora. That's a completely **arbitrary 任意的** number.

We all knew there would be times when Justin would be out of touch. 我们都知道有时候会联系不上贾斯汀

It's a mother's ==intuition 直觉==.

Nora, he'll call. I promise you. He will call.

You don't know that.

Well, sweetheart, you do have a connection with the senate.

A lot of good that's done me.

Kitty has not done one damn thing to help, except talk about her brother on national television.

Did you see that **interview 采访**?

Nora, to be fair, they were asked.

They could've said, "**No comment 无可奉告**," instead of jumping all over it, and using him as some sort of political selling point.

I had to turn it off. I tell you, I can't even bear to look at her.

Nora? Nora, what is it?

Someone's at the door. 有人按门铃.

Oh, God.

What if this is them? ==What if 如果是...怎么办== this is about Justin?

Please, please, don't do this to yourself. 别自己吓自己

It's probably just the postman.

No, he's already been here. 邮差已经来过了

I'll stay on the phone. Okay? Just answer the door. 

I don't know that I can. 我不知道自己做不做得到

You have to. Go ahead. I'm right here. 

Okay.

Okay, stay on the phone.

Surprise.

Oh, Kitty.

It's Kitty, Saul.

Good to see you. Come on in.

I knew I shouldn't have mailed her present.

Now I'm going to look like a **schmuck 笨蛋**.

**At least 至少** you're not sleeping in her bed.

So, what are we doing for her birthday?

Kitty says no **fuss 瞎操心 、过分关怀** this year.

Since when do you listen to Kitty? 你什么时候开始听Kitty的话了

Why don't you take her out for dinner? - Oh, yeah.

Good luck getting a reservation somewhere **decent** for tomorrow night.

Oh, I know a really good Mexican place across from the Pantages in Hollywood.

I love that place.

I go there every time I see **Wicked 《魔法坏女巫》**.

==It's always packed though. 不过那里一般都会爆满==

Well, I know the **hostess 老板娘**.

I really think we should respect Kitty's wishes. She was very adamant.

Well, she's probably just feeling weird.

because, you know, last year at this time...

What? Dad took the final plunge while she was blowing out her candles?

Kevin. You know, if I were her, I'd be afraid to celebrate my birthday.

Maybe there's a Kitty curse.

**The only thing she's cursed with ==are== her insane politics.**

I heard that. -Oh, sorry.

Hello, ==Rip Van Winkle==. - Hello.

We were beginning to wonder if you were ever going to get up. 我们都开始怀疑你到底起不起来了

Oh, well, you know, Mother, ==I had some trouble sleeping 我昨晚睡得不好==.

The **mattress** in the guest room is really hard.

I'd be happy to ==trade with you 和你换==.

Oh, no. No, no. It's fine.

Well, now that ==you're up 你起来了==, welcome back. ==I got to go 我该走了==.

I'm so moved.

I'll see you tomorrow.

Bye, all!

Okay. Well, I'm going to ==go(省略了to)== make a reservation.

Wow. I sure know how to clear a room.

So, what was that about a reservation?

Oh, I tried to talk to them.

They're **insisting on 坚持** getting the family togeter for your birthday.

You know, what I would really like is ==to== go shopping with my mother.

Oh, no, no, no, no. Justin might call. Sorry.

Well, we'll have our cell phones with us. 

I'll turn mine on loud.

I need a wedding dress.

Yeah. You know, so the press will stop ==obsessing 唠叨== about it, and they'll **start talking** about things that ==actually matter 真正重要的==.

Like, you know, **health care 医疗保险**.

I'd love to.

Coop **have an accident 惹事了**? - Juice box **explosion 捏爆了**.

I **stabbed 插、刺、戳** it a little ==aggressively 有闯劲地== with the straw.

It was ==either== that ==or== Monica's eye.  二选一

If it makes you feel ==any== better, she's got a masseuse named Tad.

Oh, yeah? - **Gives her a happy ending 弄得她很性福**.

**Get out 不是吧**! Shut up! - It's true. Yeah.

What else you got for me? 还有什么要告诉我的？

Amy's had two mommy **jobs（一语双关）**. 

She judges me for woking. 

Yeah. No. It's a **combo 结合体 来自combine, 组合**, tummy tuck 整腹术, boob job 隆胸术.

Oh. Then again, you know, like a lift, that'd be nice.

**You're not serious 开玩笑**.

You are still hotter than all those moms ==put together==.

Oh, come on. **You're just saying that 你就是说说而已吧**.

You think I could ==put up with 忍受== you and your family for 10 years, if I didn't think that ... You're hot.

Well, you know, **you have a point 你说得有道理**.

==Is this a bad time?== 来的不是时候？- Not at all.

Come on in. 

It's good to see you.

You know, I was **in the neighborhood 做表语**, and instead of leaving another voicemail, I thought I'd stop by.

With this. 带了这个

It's our trip to Key West.

Check out your hair.

My hair?

Take a look at your hair. What is that? A **perm 烫发**?

I thought you'd ==get a kick out of 喜欢== that.

Listen, Milo, I have...

==I have a lot of work on my desk==, so... Thanks. -No, no, no, no. No, it's for you.

==Take care 保重==, Saul.

Hey. Sorry I'm late.

Lizzie was impossible today.

I don't know if it's the **diaper rash 尿布湿疹** or the ==formula 婴儿食品== or ...

Is she sleeping?

Yeah. She's exhausted ==from== crying five hours **straight 连续地**.

Well, I'll get the next feeding.

Hey. We got the account.

Oh, that's great.

==Do you mind if== I call my parents?  介意我给父母打个电话吗？

No. That's fine.

Hey, **listen**. Before you go, 

Kitty's in town and we want to do a family birthday for her.

I'm not really ==up 准备好== for a big Walker thing.

Just ==make up 编造== an excuse. 

**Look**, I've been making up excuses all summer.

I mean, Mom**'s == has** **offered to 提出要做某事** **come by 短暂拜访** and cook, Sarah wants to bring by the kids, so they can meet their cousin...

You know what I think about when I see Paige and Cooper together?

I think about William.

She's reminded of Justin.

And she's **terrified 非常害怕的**. We're all terrified.

But it doesn't mean our lives just stop.

Look, let her help you out. You guys can talk and maybe...

I'll ==go=go to== get her. Go make your call.

My God. It's a vision of loveliness.

Mother, you haven't **weighed in 发表意见** yet.

It's lovely. You don't think I look like a fish.

Honey, if you don't like it, just try on another one.

And while you do that, I'll check in the back for **something a little more**...

 So, Mom, can you believe these dresses?

Hello. That was a question.

What are you doing, anyway? 你到底在干什么？

**Since when** do you text?

I didn't think I'd ==get the hang of it 搞定、学会、掌握==, but she was very patient.

This might be the most ==hideous 丑的吓人== dress that ever existed.

We don't **bring up 提到** Justin. The reporters do.

And what are we ==supposed to 应该== do? Not speak?

That man is taping you.

You know, I never complain we don't ==get to sleep in 睡懒觉== on Sundays.

I've been **completely open 完全公开**.

I have no idea **what** this meeting's **about**.

So, maybe you're getting a promotion.

How's my favorite birthday girl?

==Lousy 糟透了==. My mother and I had a ==really== big fight.

She says it's funnier than the ==piano-playing== cat.

What can I do to ==make it up 弥补== to you?

We **haven't heard from him** in over three weeks.

I hate that you're ==going through 承受着== this.

Not even as a birthday present? 

It would only take you one phone call.

I can't make an exception for you.

Hey, honey. I **got to** call you back. Sarah's here.

Is everything all right at home?

Did you hear what I said?

And **as a male**, what do you think he was thinking?

I mean, do you think he wants to **get back** together?

Because we've **almost** stopped fighting.

And the sex was amazing. We **were** on the washing machine.

Ew! **Blocking out** that visual.

Sorry. But seriously, I mean, maybe this seperation was **what** the relationship needed, you know?

That's it? 就这样吗？ Talk to Joe?

Look, I'm completely ==swamped with== this new account.

I haven't **finished packing up** the office.

Sorry to **intrude**. 

I see my mom doesn't **bug you about** keeping your room clean.

And I just couldn't **figure out** what to wear.

Yeah, I put them **in boxes** **in the corner**.

You want me to **grab them** for you?

No, thanks. I'll get it.

I didn't actually. I just found it in the **dresser**.
