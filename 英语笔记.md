I got a phone call from the post office. They said I need to pick up a package.



It lands in Manchester at six-thirty p.m.

The football stadium is near my house.

I found it when I was at the **antique(古老的)** shop.



That's the website which gives the **store hours 营业时间**.



Do you have any **appointments 约会**?



Good morning, sir. I would like to find a time to meet with you tomorrow. What is your calendar like? If you can't meet tomorrow, we can find a date in the near future. Please let me know when you are not busy, and we can make an appointment then.



A: What time would you like to arrange an appointment?

B: How about at 1:30 p.m.?



You're going to be **in charge of 主管** the entire office.

**The head of division 部门领导** is responsible for marketing all new products and **looking after existing ones 照顾现有的产品**.



I'm ready to be the boss of a division and **take on 承担** more responsibility.



This is not a nine-to-five job. It's around the clock.



I run this restaurant and I don't want to be **embarrassed 使人尴尬的**. 



It doesn't have sharp corners， so you won't hurt yourself when you **bump into(意外撞到/碰到，可以是人也可以是物体)** it!



Which one(offer) do you think I should pick?



Those jeans look nice on you. Are you going to buy them? 

No, I prefer my old ones.





Shen, this is an intervention(干预措施).

I just lost both of my **bonus rounds(加分回合)**!



Some of them play more than I do.



Amy: Would you like some cake now?

Mike: I ate too much pasta at dinner, so just a little bit, please.



Come stand next to me and tell me what's wrong.



**Today I went to the back of the office to get coffee.**



**In other words （换言之）**, we don't find people just any old jobs that give them a paycheck（工资）.



There's a famous saying that I found on the Internet somewhere.



Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.

**To put it another way(换言之)**, if you have a job that you love, work isn't work! 

I **make a habit of(养成习惯)** really getting to know my clients（客户）.

That means learning about their likes and dislikes and what they do in their free time.



I like listening to music. I do it **at least three hours** every day.



I have **a habit of** cooking every day because it doesn't cost a lot.



You can wear **a large**, **extra-large**, or even **an extra-extra large** shirt if it's comfortable. 

She said my shirt is too big and makes me look **sloppy(肥大而难看的/邋遢的)**. 

She asked me what size it is and I said medium.

She asked what size my shoes were and I said European size thirty-seven, which is a US size seven.

Well, we can start by getting you an **apron (围裙)** that fits better.

These clothes fit the boys well, but in a few months, they're going to be too small.

You're going to be standing for a long time, so your shoes need to be comfortable.

That one is too big on you; I think you should buy a small.

tinny small medium large 



I like that shirt. Is it my size?

Yes. Go ahead and try it!



He told me I should become a waitress.

He doesn't let me make **entrees (主菜)**.

He doesn't even let me prepare **`appetizers/starters(前菜、开胃菜)`** anymore.

There's nothing wrong with being a server, but that's **insulting 侮辱性的**.

Yesterday I made two desserts that he threw in the trash.



Good evening! My name is Delia, and I will be your `server` tonight. Please look at the `menu`. Our `appetizers`, or `starters`, are on page 1. Next, you'll find our meat dishes and other `entrees` on pages 2 and 3. And, finally, we have a long list of cakes and other `desserts` on page 4. Oh, and I almost forget! Our `special` tonight is duck with orange sauce. Our head chef prepared it from an old family `recipe` she got from her grandmother. Please take your time. When you're ready to `order`, just let me know.



There are two pieces of `cake` left. Would you like to take them home?    



Coffee always makes me feel better. I probably drink four coffees a day!

Hotel employee: The price of the hotel is for five nights. That includes five breakfasts. 

Hotel guest: In other words, lunch and dinner are **extra 额外的**. Right?



This week the student chefs are **trying out 试验** new recipes for breakfast.

How many **`coffees`** do you drink every day?

At least three.



I wasn't very hungry so I ordered an appetizer instead of a big entree.



hospitality 好客 款待

The appetizers were delicious, but the soup needed a little salt.

The meal was delicious. I'm almost full, but **I still have room for** a bit of dessert.

Are there any `specials` tonight?

Yes, a few... and they're all delicious! Let me tell you about them.



Zorba's has amazing food and music. With a little `imagination  [ɪ.mædʒɪ'neɪʃ(ə)n]`, we **felt like 感觉像** we were in Greece.
